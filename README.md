To add a sequence part you have to type a hexad√©cimal color and select the direction in which the ant will rotate when she were on this type of cell (`G` for `LEFT` and `D` for `RIGHT`).

When an ant is on a cell, she turns in the direction specified in the sequence, then she turns the cell into the next of the sequence and finally she moves forward one cell.
